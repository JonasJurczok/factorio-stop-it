A mod tomake you stop playing after a set time.

## Why?

Sometimes you get lost in the game.
To prevent coming late to work or somehwere else this mod helps you quit playing.

## Usage

Press the key combination (default `CTRL + SHIFT + S`) to open the ui.

There you can configure a countdown. At the end of the countdown the game will be closed.

The mod gives you warnings at certain intervals before the countdown finishes.
